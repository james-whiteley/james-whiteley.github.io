				<h1 style="margin-bottom:30px;">Hey Basecamp!!</h1>
				<p>Hi Jason, David, Sam and Javan</p>
				<p>My name is James, and here is why you should hire me.</p>
				<h4>I’m a human Swiss Army knife.</h4>
				<p>I’ve been working with Javascript, HTML and CSS since all the way back in 2000, when I was 12. Back then I decided to get into programming because I wanted to build cool things that people would want to use (... and after a friend sold a website for £500 - £847.16 inflation adjusted - I figured I was going to be rich). I started hacking Javascript games, tweaking and experimenting and I haven’t stopped programming like it since.</p>
				<p>I first encountered Ruby when I interviewed for a research position at the University of Sheffield, here in the UK. Hit with a surprise coding exercise, it was my sink or swim moment with Ruby, thankfully I swam.</p>
				<p>I started my own company when I was 20 years old and saw it fail by the time I turned 23. Although the company may have failed, this was when I earned my ‘human Swiss Army knife’ chops. I worked on any project clients were willing to pay me for. It didn’t matter what the tech stack was, I was going to learn by doing.</p>
				<h4>A Future With Basecamp</h4>
				<p>I would like my role in Basecamp’s future to first involve the following objectives:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Work to incrementally refactor Basecamp to be able to function almost completely offline.</li>
					<li>With the maturation of WebAssembly (my choice of newer web technology I like) work with other teams to push portions of the Rails applications’ computation to the browser.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I believe Basecamp’s role in my future will involve allowing me to produce great work, creating and developing tools and frameworks that simplify the lives of programmers everywhere. It would make a refreshing change to be surrounded by a team that forgoes complexity. In my opinion, your attitude to work and its place in the lives of your colleagues is the reason you have consistently produced over the years.</p>
				<p>A major draw is Basecamp’s stability. As somebody who has felt the pain of fiscally irresponsible founders - figuratively - making it rain, I would give my right arm to work at a company that knows when to spend and when to not. Ever since I read ReWork, I’ve been a huge fan of Basecamp’s work. I even re-listen to the audiobook every couple of months to ‘reset’ when a job has taken its toll. But I’m going to stop there before I go full fanboy, and move on.</p>
				<h4>Basecamp’s Work</h4>
				<p>My favourite project to come out of the Research & Fidelity team has got to be Stimulus. The ease with which you can read HTML and know exactly what Javascript should be doing in the browser, is incredible, and such a departure from the spaghetti code typical of the likes of jQuery. I commend you both Javan and Sam!</p>
				<p>Turbolinks and Trix may not be everybody’s cups of tea, but what they were designed to do, they do wonderfully. I respect how as a company, you don’t try to make everything for everyone.</p>
				<h4>About Me</h4>
				<h6>I hoard knowledge</h6>
				<p>I read everyday, books that provide me with a broad spectrum of knowledge from business to biology, probability to physics. I believe that the only way to make intelligent decisions is to develop a variety of mental models of the world. An idea I have borrowed from Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman, Charlie Munger.</p>
				<h6>Quick-fire Facts</h6>
				<ul>
					<li>I’ve been a type 1 diabetic since I was 4 years old.</li>
					<li>I’m a rambler (I mean I like hiking in the mountains, not that I can't stop talking!).</li>
					<li>I’m a massive Liverpool Football Club fan.</li>
					<li>The closest I ever got to Basecamp (Everest Basecamp that is) was hiking the Annapurna Circuit in the Himalayas, when I was 16.</li>
					<li>Visual Studio Code is my IDE of choice.</li>
					<li>I love the beat of a mechanical keyboard.</li>
					<li>Contrary to what my mother told me, I always talk to strangers, because you never know what you’ll learn.</li>
					<li>I once received an awkwardly long hug from a drunken Clive Owen (the actor).</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Thanks</h4>
				<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this application and I look forward to hearing your feedback.</p>
